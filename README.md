Wordsmith is designed to be the roleplayer's best friend. It has a few features that help keep the roleplay in game without needing outside tools. The main features of Wordsmith are:

* [Powerful "Scratch Pads"!](#scratch-pads)
* [Selectable chunk headers!](#chunk-headers)
* [Custom continuation markers!](#continuation-markers)
* [OOC toggle!](#ooc-toggle)
* [Spell Check!](#spell-check)
* [A thesaurus?!](#thesaurus)
* [How To Install](#how-to-install)

## Scratch Pads


The Scratch Pads are the star feature here. You enter the text into the textbox at the bottom and it will display the chunks above. When you're done typing, click the "Copy" button. It will always copy your chunks with whatever header you choose so you never have to worry about sending to the wrong chat again. When you click copy, it copies the first chunk. Then, if there are 2, 3, or even 20, each click will copy the next chunk in line. It's a simple one click, then paste and send for each chunk with no effort on your part. It will even try to break the text on sentences (if that setting is enabled.)

## Chunk Headers

Chunk Headers are the text that will be put in front of each copied chunk. Easily select chat mode at the top of the scratch pad. Each pad can have its own chat mode, too. Paste with confidence knowing that you'll never paste into the wrong chat again. You can choose your chunk headers by using the drop down as shown above or by typing it like you would in a normal chat window (i.e. /p will automatically select party chat for you. ) You can even create custom aliases. Have someone you roleplay with frequently in /tell? Create an alias for it! For example, if you create an alias for "/t My Friend@ThaWorld" as "friendo". Just type /friendo and it will automatically change to "/t My Friend@ThaWorld" making it quick and easy to access your favorite chat modes. The lock button on the left disables typing of chat headers just in case you want to make sure you don't accidentally type a change.

## Continuation Markers
Continuation markers are those things you put at the end of a post to tell the other reader that there is more coming. A lot of people put (c) or <c> or something like that. Well, Wordsmith handles that for you automatically and you can even customize what it places. It even handles special placeholders.

When you customize your continuation marker, if you put a placeholder, Wordsmith will automatically replace it with the relevant information. For instance, #c is replaced with the current chunk number while #m is the maximum number it will go up to. So if you did "(Chunk #c of #m)" as your continuation marker, it would write "(Chunk 1 of 3)" then "(Chunk 2 of 3)" then, finally, "(Chunk 3 of 3)" for you. I personally use (#c/#m). Feel free to get creative or use a classic like (c).

## OOC Toggle

With togglable OOC brackets just a click away, it's super easy to switch in and out of OOC talk with ease. You don't even have to rewrite anything. OOC tags are calculated in real time and are designed to be simple to use. Just click the toggle at the end of the chat header selection.

## Spell Check
The Spell Check feature will compare your text to a dictionary of known words. If it finds any spelling errors, you'll get a red notification at the top saying how many it found and a new text entry space at the bottom where you can enter a replacement word or click "Add To Dictionary" if you want it to remember your word! 

Once you type in your replacement word, you can just hit the enter key or click "Replace" and it will automatically replace the word for you.

## Thesaurus

With a built-in thesaurus functionality (brought to you by Merriam-Webster), creative writing is easy. Ever roleplayer knows the struggle to not type redundantly. After all, everyone gets exhausted reading the same things over and over. Well now you can pop open the thesaurus, do a quick search for your word and get some pretty great suggestions. Turn, "She ran quickly," into "She scampered fleetly!" Obviously, not everything will return a result, but it's a pretty huge library of words at your fingertips!
