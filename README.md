## Scratch Pads

The Scratch Pads are the star feature here. You enter the text into the textbox at the bottom and it will display the chunks above. When you're done typing, click the "Copy" button. Notice that it changes to say "Copy with ..." if you select a header. It will always copy your chunks with whatever header you choose so you never have to worry about sending to the wrong chat again. When you click copy, it copies the first chunk. Then, if there are 2, 3, or even 20, each click will copy the next chunk in line. It's a simple one click, then paste and send for each chunk with no effort on your part. It will even try to break the text on sentences.

## Chunk Headers

Chunk Headers (highlighted by a red box in the screenshots above) are the text that will be put in front of each copied chunk. Paste with confidence knowing that you'll never paste into the wrong chat again.

## Continuation Markers

Continuation markers are those things you put at the end of a post to tell the other reader that there is more coming. A lot of people put (c) or <c> or something like that. Well, Wordsmith handles that for you automatically and you can even customize what it places. It even handles special placeholders.

When you customize your continuation marker, if you put a placeholder, Wordsmith will automatically replace it with the relevant information. For instance, #c is replaced with the current chunk number while #m is the maximum number it will go up to. So if you did "(Chunk #c of #m)" as your continuation marker, it would wrote "(Chunk 1 of 3)" then "(Chunk 2 of 3)" then, finally, "(Chunk 3 of 3)" for you. I personally use (#c/#m). Feel free to get creative or use a classic like (c).

## OOC Toggle

With togglable OOC brackets just a click away, it's super easy to switch in and out of OOC talk with ease. You don't even have to rewrite anything. OOC tags are calculated in real time and are designed to be simple to use.

## Spell Check

The Spell Check feature will compare your text to a dictionary of known words. If it finds any spelling errors, you'll get a red notification (highlighted by a red box) at the top saying how many it found and a new text entry space at the bottom (highlighted by a red box) where you can enter a replacement word or click "Add To Dictionary" if you want it to remember your word! 

Once you type in your replacement word, you can just hit the enter key or click "Replace" and it will automatically replace the word for you.

## Thesaurus

With a built-in thesaurus, creative writing is easy. Ever roleplayer knows the struggle to not type redundantly. After all, everyone gets exhausted reading the same things over and over. Well now you can pop open the thesaurus, do a quick search for your word and get some pretty great suggestions. Turn, "She ran quickly," into "She scampered fleetly" easily.

The thesaurus references a large library of synonyms, antonyms, and related words to bring you great results. Obviously, not everything will return a result, but it's a pretty huge library of words at your finger tips!
